-> Github is a hosting service for git repository 
-> we can host our git repository on Github 

1) Create your GitHub Acoount
-> its free for unlimited public and private repositories
and for 3 private collaborations.
Best for project management

After creating account 
->
Top right + 
new repository 
name your new repository
you can add description of your repository
public it or private
public (for everyone)
private (only you can watch untill its public)
-> we will make private first
check the read.me file 

What is remote repository??
Remote repository is the repository we create on Github
the folder we have in our laptop is called local repository
we push local repository to remote repository

what is remote?? 
remote is a link from which we can add our remote repository to local repository
so we have to copy the given remote link from remote repository and add it in our terminal 
-> git remote add origin https://github.com/Turwash/MyFirstRepo.git (origin will be the short name for link)
it is a url where we will host our repository
-> git remote (to check the remote name , here, origin)
-> git remove -v (to check the link of origin (fetch and push))




TO CLONE GITHUB REPOSITORY 
1) copy the url of repository
2) -> git clone AddUrlOfRepository namethefolder(if not it will be same as in github)
ls to check the folder
 
-> git pull (bring code from github to local repository)

*** IMPORTANT ***
ADD DIRECTLY THROUGH LINK 
USING COMMANDS IN GITHUB ONLY 

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Turwash/test.git
git push -u origin main

AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PUSH YOUR REPOSITORY TO GITHUB
