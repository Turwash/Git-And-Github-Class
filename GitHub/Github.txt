-> Github is a hosting service for git repository 
-> we can host our git repository on Github 

1) Create your GitHub Acoount
-> its free for unlimited public and private repositories
and for 3 private collaborations.
Best for project management

After creating account 
->
Top right + 
new repository 
name your new repository
you can add description of your repository
public it or private
public (for everyone)
private (only you can watch untill its public)
-> we will make private first
check the read.me file 

What is remote repository??
Remote repository is the repository we create on Github
the folder we have in our laptop is called local repository
we push local repository to remote repository

what is remote?? 
remote is a link from which we can add our remote repository to local repository
so we have to copy the given remote link from remote repository and add it in our terminal 
-> git remote add origin https://github.com/Turwash/MyFirstRepo.git (origin will be the short name for link)
it is a url where we will host our repository
-> git remote (to check the remote name , here, origin)
-> git remove -v (to check the link of origin (fetch and push))

-> git push origin master (push origin to master)
it will say repository not found 
because its a private repository
Now to give read write permission (Giving access of github accoount to computer)
go to github repo -> setting -> SSH And GPG keys -> generating SSH keys -> generating a new SSH key to your github account
-> generating new SSH key -> copy the code of email id and then add your email id to it and paste the code in terminal
then it will give you your key fingerprint
now, we have to deploy this key 
Scroll down go to adding SSH key 
select->  eval $(ssh-agent -s) -> after this you will get your agent key process ID
then add another code -> $ ssh-add ~/id_rsa (identity added)
Now,
click -> Add SSH key to github account
Now take code -> cat ~/ .ssh/id_rsa.pub (cat use to show the content inside it)
now copy the content 
go to github repo -> setting -> SSH And GPG keys -> ADD SSH keys
Title add -> My computer 
Key -> paste the key 


-> Now go to your repository , select SSH and copy the link 
come to terminal 
write
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Turwashetcetcetc.git (add url (shift+insert))
we do this to change the url we added earlier
now
-> git push -u origin master 
(Pushed) when you want to push again directly use -> git push (it will push in the same location)
every files will be uploaded to github 
You can also add your branches
-> git push -u origin branchname

TO CLONE GITHUB REPOSITORY 
1) copy the url of repository
2) -> git clone AddUrlOfRepository namethefolder(if not it will be same as in github)
ls to check the folder
 
-> git pull (bring code from github to local repository)

*** IMPORTANT ***
NO NEED OF SSH KEY , ADD DIRECTLY THROUGH LINK 
USING COMMANDS IN GITHUB ONLY 

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Turwash/test.git
git push -u origin main

AND YOU WILL BE ABLE TO PUSH YOUR REPOSITORY TO GITHUB
